	<h1>Welcome to hackerYou!</h1>

	<p>HackerYou offers Toronto’s <strong>best</strong> full- and part-time courses for people who want to <em>learn to code</em>. Whether you’re looking to climb the corporate ladder, upgrade your skills, or start an exciting new career, HackerYou is for you.</p>

	<h2>About us</h2>

	<p>But sometimes online tutorials, one-day workshops and <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> don’t cut it. Neither do most university or college courses, in our opinion. At HackerYou, we’re on a mission to offer the best learning experience for anyone who wants to learn to code. The recipe? Hands-on, project-based learning from industry leaders. Small classes, and a <em>10:1 ratio (or better!)</em> of students to instructors. Hosted in learning environments that inspire. And with both full-time and part-time courses, HackerYou can fit into your life.</p>

	<p><em>Make 2017 the year you finally learn to code, so that you can climb the corporate ladder, <strong>upgrade your skills</strong>, or start an exciting new career. We’re here to help you get there.</em></p>
