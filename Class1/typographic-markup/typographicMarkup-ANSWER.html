	<h1>Welcome to hackerYou!</h1>

	<p>HackerYou offers Toronto’s best full- and part-time courses for people who want to <em>learn to code</em>. Whether you’re looking to climb the corporate ladder, upgrade your skills, or start an exciting new career, HackerYou is for you.</p>

	<h2>About us</h2>

	<p>But sometimes online tutorials, one-day workshops and Stack Overflow don’t cut it. Neither do most university or college courses, in our opinion. At <strong>HackerYou, we’re on a mission to offer the best learning experience for anyone who wants to learn to code</strong>. The recipe? Hands-on, project-based learning from industry leaders. Small classes, and a 10:1 ratio (or better!) of students to instructors. Hosted in learning environments that inspire. And with both full-time and part-time courses, HackerYou can fit into your life.</p>
	
	<p>Make 2017 the year you finally learn to code, so that you can climb the corporate ladder, upgrade your skills, or start an exciting new career. We’re here to help you get there.</p>
