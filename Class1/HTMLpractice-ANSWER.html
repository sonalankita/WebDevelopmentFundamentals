	<!-- Look through the HTML below and change the presentational tags into semantic tags - Find "Content vs Style" in the Intro to HTML class in the notes if you need some hints!-->

	<!-- ANSWER: replace the <b> and <u> tags with <strong> or <em> tags. Remember that emphasis and strong are more descriptive than bold and underline, especially to those using screen readers and other assistive technology -->

	<h1>Let's remember to use semantic, meaningful elements instead of presentation elements</h1>

	<p>To truly <em>understand</em> why using semantic elements is <strong>important</strong>, we need to think beyond our own computers. Our audience should not simply be able-bodied, visual users. Users that are visually impaired will use screen readers that read the contents of the webpage to them aurally.</p>

	<p>An underlined piece of text is of no interest to a visually impaired user. If the underline is being used to <em>emphasize content,</em> the screen-reader will simply ignore it. In your markup, use an <strong>element as it has semantic meaning.</strong></p>
